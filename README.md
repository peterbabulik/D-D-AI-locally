## üìù Customization

### Modifying Characters

Edit the `characters.js` file to change existing characters or add new ones:

```javascript
// Example of adding a new character
{
    name: "Eldon",
    role: "Player",
    race: "Dwarf",
    class: "Paladin",
    level: 5,
    maxHealth: 50,
    abilities: ["Divine Smite", "Lay on Hands", "Divine Sense"],
    startingItems: ["Warhammer", "Shield", "Plate Armor", "Holy Symbol"],
    personality: "Gruff but kind-hearted dwarf who follows his oath with unwavering conviction."
}
```

### Campaign Settings

The initial campaign state is created in the `loadDatabase()` function in `index.js`. Modify this to start with different settings:

```javascript
return {
    gameLog: [],
    campaignState: {
        location: "Ancient ruins of Dragonspire",
        quest: "Recover the lost amulet of Orcus",
        inventory: {},
        npcs: ["High Priestess Ela", "Trader Gormund"],
        combatActive: false,
        currentScene: "Campaign Start"
    },
    characters: characters.map(char => ({
        ...char,
        health: char.maxHealth || 100,
        inventory: char.startingItems || []
    }))
};
```
### Change ollama model:

now we using gemma3:1b with ollama, you can change it in line 139 in index.js for other ollama models:

```javascript
// Game loop
    while (true) {
        // First, the Game Master takes a turn
        const gameMaster = characters.find(char => char.role === "Game Master");
        
        if (gameMaster) {
            const gmContext = generateGameMasterContext(db);
            console.log(`\n[Game Master is narrating the scene...]`);
            const gmResponse = await askOllama('gemma3:1b', gmContext);
            
            if (gmResponse) {
                console.log(`\nüé≤ GAME MASTER: ${gmResponse}\n`);
                
                // Log GM's narration
                const gmEvent = {
                    actor: "Game Master",
                    event: gmResponse,
                    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
                };
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Game Loop**:
   - The GM describes the current scene or situation
   - Each player character responds in turn
   - The system tracks and updates the game state
   - Repeat

2. **State Management**:
   - All game data is stored in `dnd_campaign.json`
   - Includes game log, campaign state, and character information
   - Persists between application restarts

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Uses Ollama's API for text generation
   - Custom prompts provide context to each character
   - System analyzes responses to update game state

[Game Master is narrating the scene...]

üé≤ GAME MASTER: The fire crackles merrily in the hearth of the "Sleeping Dragon" tavern, casting dancing shadows on the rough-hewn wooden walls. The air is thick with the smell of roasted meat, stale ale, and woodsmoke. A low hum of conversation fills the room ‚Äì a mix of weary travelers, local villagers, and the occasional boisterous laugh. 

You all sit around a sturdy oak table, mugs of ale in hand, having just arrived in Mistwood Village. The village itself is nestled at the edge of the vast, ancient Mistwood ‚Äì a place whispered about in hushed tones, known for its dense fog, strange creatures, and forgotten ruins. 

A stout woman with rosy cheeks and a warm smile approaches your table. She wears a simple, patched-up dress and a practical apron. This is Elara, the tavern owner.

"Welcome, travelers, welcome!" she says, her voice friendly and welcoming. "You look like you've had a long journey. Anything I can get for you? Fresh bread, hearty stew... or perhaps some information about Mistwood?" She winks. "It's not always a place people *want* to talk about."

She pauses, her eyes scanning each of you briefly. "You seem like you're not from around here. Are you perhaps seeking work? Old Man Hemlock, the village elder, is always looking for capable hands. Or maybe you're interested in the history of the Mistwood? There are stories aplenty, both good and‚Ä¶ not so good."

**What do you do?**

You can:

* **Talk to Elara:** Ask her about Mistwood, Old Man Hemlock, or any rumors she might have heard.
* **Ask around the tavern:** Try to glean information from other patrons.
* **Leave the tavern:** Explore the village or head towards the Mistwood.
* **Something else:** Describe your own action.

[Waiting for all players to decide their actions...]

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇTHORNE: I take a long swig of my ale, letting the taste settle on my tongue before meeting Elara's gaze directly. My hand rests subtly on the hilt of my greatsword, not aggressively, but a familiar gesture of readiness. 

"Mistwood, you say?" I ask, my voice a low rumble, steady and direct. "I've heard whispers of it. Dangerous things dwell in those woods, they say. I'm always open to a job that requires a strong arm and a clear head. Old Man Hemlock, you mentioned? What kind of work does he typically need done?" 

I keep my eyes open and observant, taking in Elara's reaction. I'm not one for pleasantries, but I appreciate a direct answer. I want to know if this village and its elder offer a path to useful work, and if there's any indication of trouble brewing in the Mistwood. 

"And," I add, after a brief pause, "if you have any stories about the Mistwood... I'm a keen listener. A soldier learns to listen to the wind, and the wind often carries secrets."






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇLYRA: I take a slow sip of my ale, letting the rich flavor coat my tongue before setting the mug down with a gentle clink. I regard Elara with a thoughtful expression, my keen eyes taking in the details of her face ‚Äì the lines of kindness around her eyes, the slight weariness beneath the warmth.

"Mistwood, you say?" I inquire, my voice carrying a hint of intellectual curiosity. "Indeed, it has a reputation. I've read fragments of ancient texts hinting at forgotten civilizations swallowed by the wood, and tales of‚Ä¶ unusual phenomena. Old Man Hemlock, you mention? Is he well-versed in the lore of the Mistwood? I'm particularly interested in any legends concerning pre-human settlements or perhaps‚Ä¶ magical occurrences."

I pause, considering. "I am, admittedly, a scholar of sorts. I find the interplay of history and magic endlessly fascinating. Any whispers you might have heard, even if they are considered 'not so good,' would be most welcome." I offer a small, polite smile, hoping to encourage her to share. I subtly adjust the strap of my spellbook, a silent reminder of my own capabilities, but not in a boastful way. Just‚Ä¶ a quiet acknowledgement of my skills.






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇGRIMBLE: (Eyes Elara up and down with a playful smirk, taking a long swig of my ale)

"Well met, good woman! Elara, you say? A fine name for a fine tavern keeper. Mistwood, eh? It certainly *looks* like a place that holds a few secrets. And secrets... well, secrets are my specialty." I lean forward conspiratorially, lowering my voice slightly. "Old Man Hemlock, you say? Is he looking for someone with a knack for finding things? Lost trinkets, perhaps? Or... something a little more valuable?"

(I give a wink, hoping to gauge her reaction and see if she's receptive to a bit of playful deception. My fingers subtly twitch towards my belt, where my thieves' tools are safely tucked away.) 

"And while you're at it, any juicy rumors you might have heard about the Mistwood? Whispers of forgotten ruins, hidden treasures... anything that might pique a rogue's interest?" I finish with a grin, trying to appear charming and approachable, but with a hint of my underlying mischievousness.






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇAURELIA: I offer Elara a warm smile, taking a slow sip of my ale. "Welcome to Mistwood, to you as well, Elara. Indeed, we are travelers, and new to these parts. Mistwood‚Ä¶ it holds a certain mystique, doesn't it? We've heard whispers of its ancient ruins and‚Ä¶ unusual inhabitants. I'm particularly interested in learning more about the history of the forest. Do you have any tales to share? Perhaps something Old Man Hemlock might be looking for?"

I lean forward slightly, my gaze earnest. "I am Aurelia, a cleric of Pelor. I seek to understand the world and help those in need. If there's a way I can assist the village, or learn something of value from its history, I am eager to do so." I gently touch my holy symbol, a small sun pendant, as I speak. 

My tone is respectful and open, hoping to build rapport with Elara and gain valuable information. I want to show my willingness to help and my genuine interest in the village and its history.






[Game Master is narrating the scene...]

üé≤ GAME MASTER: Elara‚Äôs eyes twinkle as she takes in your varied approaches. She seems pleased by the interest in Mistwood, and particularly by Aurelia‚Äôs respectful demeanor. She sets down a polishing rag and leans against the bar, a thoughtful expression on her face.

"Well met to you all," she says, her voice softening slightly. "You've certainly piqued my interest. You're right, Mistwood *does* hold secrets. And Old Man Hemlock‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs always looking for someone with a sharp mind and a strong back. He‚Äôs particularly concerned about the recent‚Ä¶ disturbances in the woods. Things have been‚Ä¶ restless."

She pauses, glancing around the tavern as if wary of being overheard. "He's been searching for something lost ‚Äì a relic, some say. Something connected to the old civilizations that supposedly thrived here before‚Ä¶ well, before the Mistwood swallowed them whole. He believes it could help protect the village from whatever's stirring in the deeper woods."

Elara leans closer, lowering her voice. "There are whispers of strange lights, unsettling howls, and‚Ä¶ things moving in the fog that aren't quite right. Some say it's just the wild creatures of the Mistwood, but others‚Ä¶ others speak of something older, something‚Ä¶ *awakening*."

She looks at each of you in turn. "As for stories‚Ä¶ there are plenty. Tales of forgotten temples, of powerful mages who attempted to harness the Mistwood's power, and of creatures born from the fog itself. But some of those stories are best left untold. They tend to‚Ä¶ unsettle people."

She smiles again, a hint of mischief in her eyes. "Old Man Hemlock is in his cottage just beyond the tavern. It's the first door on the left as you leave the building. He's a bit‚Ä¶ eccentric, but he's a good man. And he appreciates a good story, especially if it involves helping the village."

**What do you do?**

You can:

* **Go to Old Man Hemlock's cottage:** Head to the cottage and speak with him directly.
* **Ask Elara more about the disturbances:** Press her for more details about the strange occurrences in the Mistwood.
* **Ask other patrons:** Try to glean more information from the other people in the tavern.
* **Leave the tavern and explore the village:** Take a walk around Mistwood Village to get a better feel for the place.
* **Something else:** Describe your own action.

[Waiting for all players to decide their actions...]

 THORNE: My hand instinctively goes to the hilt of my greatsword, a familiar comfort. The mention of "disturbance" and "something awakening" in the Mistwood sends a chill down my spine, a prickle of unease that a soldier knows well. I meet Elara's gaze, my expression serious but not unfriendly.

"Disturbances, you say?" I ask, my voice low and steady. "What kind of disturbances? Are we talking about wild beasts, or something‚Ä¶ else?" I pause, letting the question hang in the air. "And this relic Old Man Hemlock seeks... what is it said to do? Could it truly protect the village from whatever is stirring in the woods?"

I consider Elara's warning about unsettling stories. While I'm not one to shy away from danger, I'm also not reckless. I need to understand the threat before rushing headlong into it. 

"I'll be heading to Old Man Hemlock's cottage," I state, my tone firm. "It seems a wise course of action to hear directly from the man who is concerned about these‚Ä¶ disturbances. Perhaps I can offer my services, if needed." I give Elara a curt nod, a gesture of respect. "Thank you for the information."



I then turn and head towards the door, making my way towards the cottage Elaara described. I walk with a purposeful stride, my senses alert, scanning the surroundings as I go. I keep my hand near my sword, ready for anything.






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇLYRA: My eyes gleam with interest as Elara speaks of ancient civilizations and restless woods. I subtly adjust my spectacles, a nervous habit when I'm deep in thought.

"A relic, you say?" I ask, my voice laced with intellectual curiosity. "Connected to the old civilizations... fascinating. What sort of relic? Do the legends speak of magical artifacts, perhaps imbued with potent energies? Or something more‚Ä¶ arcane?"

I pause, considering. "The disturbances you mention‚Ä¶ the strange lights, the unsettling howls‚Ä¶ could these be connected to the relic? Or is something else stirring in the Mistwood, drawing attention to it?"

I glance towards Elara, a hopeful expression on my face. "And if Old Man Hemlock is concerned about these disturbances, does he have any theories as to *what* is causing them? Any particular creatures or phenomena he suspects are responsible? I've studied many texts on the creatures that inhabit the wild places, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge."

I take a small, deliberate step forward, my hand instinctively hovering near my spellbook. "I am, as you may have gathered, quite interested in the history and magical properties of this region. If I can be of assistance in locating this relic or understanding the source of the disturbances, I would be honored to lend my skills." I offer a polite, yet earnest, smile. "Tell me more about this relic, Elara. Any details, no matter how seemingly insignificant, could prove valuable."






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇGRIMBLE: (I lean forward, a sly grin spreading across my face. I glance at Elara, then back at the other patrons in the tavern, my eyes lingering on a few who seem particularly keen to listen. I subtly adjust the strap of my belt, ensuring my thieves' tools remain concealed.)

"Lost relics, you say?" I ask, my voice a low, almost conspiratorial murmur. "And things stirring in the deeper woods‚Ä¶ that sounds like a job with a bit of‚Ä¶ *intrigue*. I'm quite adept at finding things that are misplaced, and I have a knack for navigating‚Ä¶ tricky situations. Especially those shrouded in mystery."

I pause, letting my words hang in the air. "Tell me more about this relic, Elara. What kind of thing is it? And what makes Old Man Hemlock so concerned about it being found? Is it simply a matter of historical preservation, or is there something more‚Ä¶ *dangerous* involved?"

(I give a small, appraising glance towards the door leading to Old Man Hemlock's cottage, then back to Elara, my expression a mixture of curiosity and barely concealed excitement.)

"And while you're at it," I add with a wink, "if there are any rumors of hidden paths or forgotten tunnels that might lead to this relic‚Ä¶ well, a rogue can never have too many options, now can he?"






üßô‚Äç‚ôÇAURELIA: I nod slowly, absorbing Elara's words with a focused gaze. The mention of disturbances and a relic stirs a sense of purpose within me. Protecting the innocent and upholding good is my calling, and a threat to this village in the Mistwood is a concern I must address.

"Thank you, Elara," I say, my voice calm and steady. "This is‚Ä¶ most helpful. The idea of something 'awakening' in the Mistwood is troubling. It speaks of a darkness that needs to be contained." I pause, then look directly at Elara. "The relic Old Man Hemlock seeks‚Ä¶ do you know anything more about it? Its purpose? Its history?"

I then turn my attention to Old Man Hemlock's cottage. "I believe I will pay Old Man Hemlock a visit. If there is a threat to this village, it is my duty to learn of it and offer what aid I can. Perhaps I can use my abilities to discern the nature of this 'awakening' and assist in protecting the village."

I give Elara a respectful nod. "And thank you for your hospitality. I appreciate you sharing this information with me." With that, I turn and head towards the cottage, my hand instinctively resting on the hilt of my greatsword, a silent promise of protection. I walk with a determined, yet measured pace, mindful of my surroundings.
